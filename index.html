    4. What is a query string?
    A query string is additional info tacked on to the end of a URL
    that modifies the page.

    5. What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?

    change the server data. POST requests sends information
    and DOES change the server data.

    6. What is an HTTP request?

    7. What is an HTTP response?
    A response from the server to the client that follows HTTP,
    in the form of code such as HTML.

    8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    Headers give extra information about requests and responses.
    Requests: Accept, Cookie, Host
    Response: Content-Type, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control.

    9. What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?
    The browser resolves the URL into an IP address using the DNS. 
    Afterwards, it makes a request to the IP address for request headers, then
    the server sends response headers in the form of HTML. Then, the browsers creates
    a DOM, locates additional resources and makes a request for each.
